# Placing all the spawns by hand would get really annoying, this allows them
# to be placed automatically.
# The path variables tell where the grid begins and ends; vehicles spawn along
# this path. If there is more than one path variable, it uses cubic interpolation.
# More than one STARTGRID is allowed. I already have a course that incorperates
# multiple starting grids.
