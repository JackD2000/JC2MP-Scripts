# JC2-MP Hivemind Server Plugins #

This repository contains all the plugins we run on our JC2-MP server. Our main goal is to create our own plugins as well as to incorperate these with the already available ones.

The plugins inside of this repository were mostly created by the developers of the [Just Cause 2: Multiplayer mod](http://www.jc-mp.com/). There are also a few plugins taken from the forums of the mod. A full list of plugins and authors can be seen at the end of this document.

It should be noted that the community plugins that we have incorperated into our project have been modified to work better with our own plugins.
